# Ponytail Help

Display this reference card when invoked. One-shot, do NOT change mode,
write flag files, or persist anything.

## Levels

| Level | Trigger | What change |
|-------|---------|-------------|
| **Lite** | `/ponytail lite` | Build what was asked, name the smaller option in one line. |
| **Full** | `/ponytail` | The smallest complete change, a check where the logic needs one, and a reply that names what was skipped and any risk. Default. |
| **Ultra** | `/ponytail ultra` | Also questions the request and pushes back before building. |

Level sticks until changed or session end.

## Skills

| Skill | Trigger | What it does |
|-------|---------|--------------|
| **ponytail** | `/ponytail` | Lazy mode itself: least new code, clear replies that name skipped work and risks. |
| **ponytail-review** | `/ponytail-review` | Quality review of a diff: bugs, security, load, missing tests, speed, what to cut. Each finding says what goes wrong and how to fix it. |
| **ponytail-audit** | `/ponytail-audit` | The same quality review for the whole repo, ranked. |
| **ponytail-debt** | `/ponytail-debt` | Harvest `shortcut:` comments into a tracked ledger. |
| **ponytail-gain** | `/ponytail-gain` | Measured-impact scoreboard: less code, less cost, more speed. |
| **ponytail-help** | `/ponytail-help` | This card. |

In Codex CLI and the IDE extension, invoke skills with `$ponytail:ponytail`,
`$ponytail:ponytail-review`, or `$ponytail:ponytail-help`. Claude Code and OpenCode use the
slash-command forms above (OpenCode ships all six as slash commands).

## Deactivate

Say "stop ponytail" or "normal mode". Resume anytime with `/ponytail`.
`/ponytail off` also works.

## In this repo

Installed as project skills in `.claude/skills/`, without the plugin's hooks:
ponytail mode is **off** until someone types `/ponytail` (it is never turned on
automatically), and the level lasts for that conversation only. The review,
audit, debt, gain and help skills work as described above.

## Update

Copied from upstream v5.2.0 (commit 2961b52); local changes are listed in
`.claude/skills/ponytail/UPSTREAM.md`. To update, copy the six
`skills/*/SKILL.md` files from https://github.com/DietrichGebert/ponytail
again and re-apply those changes.
